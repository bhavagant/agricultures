    <h1>AGRONOMY</h1>
<p>Agronomy is the science and technology of producing and using plants by agriculture for food, fuel, fiber, chemicals, recreation, or land conservation. Agronomy has come to include research of plant genetics, plant physiology, meteorology, and soil science. It is the application of a combination of sciences such as biology, chemistry, economics, ecology, earth science, and genetics. Professionals of agronomy are termed agronomists.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Agronomy has a long and rich history dating to the Neolithic Revolution. Some of the earliest practices of agronomy are found in ancient civilizations, including Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, China and India. They developed various techniques for the management of soil fertility, irrigation and crop rotation.
    
    During the 18th and 19th centuries, advances in science led to the development of modern agronomy. German chemist Justus von Liebig and John Bennett Lawes, an English entrepreneur, contributed to the understanding of plant nutrition and soil chemistry. Their work laid for the establishment of modern fertilizers and agricultural practices.
    
    Agronomy continued to evolve with the development of new technology and practices in the 20th century. From the 1960s, the Green Revolution saw the introduction of high-yield variety of crops, modern fertilizers and improvement of agricultural practices. It led to an increase of global food production to help reduce hunger and poverty in many parts of the world.
    Agronomic experiments focus on a variety of factors relating to crop plants, including yield, diseases, cultivation, pest and weed management, and sensitivity to factors such as climate and soil. Agronomists may specialize in plant breeding and biotechnology to improve crops. Many agronomists also utilize ecological principles to conserve and protect the environment from the negative effects of agriculture, a field known as agroecology.</p>
<h1>What is AGRONOMY</h1>
<p>Agronomy looks at agriculture from an integrated, holistic perspective. Agronomists are specialists in crop and soil science, as well as ecology. Some things they look at are:

  1.  The properties of the soil;
  2.  How the soil interacts with the growing crop;
  3.  What nutrients (fertilizers) the crop needs;
  4.  When and how to apply these nutrients;
  5.  The ways that crops grow and develop;
  6.  How climate and other environmental factors affect the crop at all stages;
  7.  How best to control weeds, insects, fungi, and other crop pests; and,
  8.  How to grow crops effectively and profitably while conserving and protecting the environment.</p>
  <p>  Agronomic crops can also be grouped by the type of crop grown. Many agronomists specialize in one or more types of crops. According to the USDA the major crops grown in the US are:
    
    Soybeans
    Corn
    Wheat
    Hay
    Cotton
    Grain sorghum
    Rice
    Oats
    Barley

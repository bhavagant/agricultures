    <h1>ANIMAL HUSBANDY</h1>
    <h2>What is Animal Husbandry?</h2><p>
        Animal husbandry refers to livestock raising and selective breeding. It is the management and care of animals in which the genetic qualities and behavior of animals are further developed for profit. A large number of farmers depend upon animal husbandry for their livelihood.
        
        Animals provide us with a variety of food products which have high nutritional values. Therefore, they require a lot of care and attention.
        
        Animals are bred commercially in order to meet the high demand for food. Dairy products from animals like cows, buffaloes, goats, are rich sources of protein. These animals are called milch animals as they provide us with milk.
        
        Another set of animals that provide nutrient-rich food are hen, ducks, goose, etc. They provide us with eggs, which again are rich sources of protein.
        
        Animals like chicken, duck, ox, goat, pigs, etc. are bred for meat. Other than these domestic animals we have other sources of nutrients as well, they are marine animals. The seafood we eat has very high nutrient values. They are sources of a variety of nutrients like fat, proteins, vitamins and minerals.
        
        The care, breeding, management, etc of animals are particularly monitored under the department of animal husbandry. Animal husbandry is a large scale business. The animals are bred, cared, reared and sheltered in a farm or region, which are specially built for them. Animal husbandry involves poultry, milk-farms, apiculture (bee agriculture), aquaculture, etc.</p>

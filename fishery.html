    <h1>FISHERY SCIENCE</h1>
<p>Fisheries science has benefited from other types of evidence-based decision-making processes, particularly those used to evaluate differing management strategies (e.g. Kinas and Andrade, 2007). The frequentist method of modelling environmental responses to management strategies has largely given way to the more powerful Bayesian approach which quantifies the influence of new information on our plausibility estimates based on existing knowledge (Punt and Hilborn, 1997). This method has been widely used in fisheries for quantifying the effect of competing strategies, against uncertainty in the data (measurement error), and against uncertainty in the way nature works (process error), represented as a set of different scenarios each with its own likelihood. The outcome of any candidate management strategy is assessed by comparing its average outcome (weighted by its likelihood) with the outcomes of other scenarios. In this way the robustness of each candidate strategy to a range of uncertainties, in both measurements and processes, can be evaluated. Bayesian analysis permits a range of qualitative and quantitative data into the decision-making process.

    Evidence-based decision-making encourages stakeholders to integrate the best available research evidence with their expertise when making decisions (Greenhalgh et al., 2014). A challenge for many conservation decisions is that quantitative evidence (such as required by fisheries science) will typically not be available to all the objectives that are deemed relevant to a decision (think, for example, of an objective like ‘minimise social conflict’). This can be a source of discomfort for those more familiar with models that aim to understand and measure a physical system, with the result that objectives that are not easy to quantify in models are sometimes down-weighted or ignored (Gregory et al., 2006). This is unfortunate, because the field of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) provides a set of well-developed and tested tools to both measure performance of elements that are unavoidably subjective, and to compare the performance of actions across all relevant aspects that lead to a decision (see e.g. Belton and Stewart (2002) for an overview of MCDA and Kiker et al. (2005) for a review of environmental applications). MCDA embodies the philosophy of evidence-based practices and applies it to the decision-making process itself.</p>
<p>Fisheries Science is an academic field of understanding and managing fisheries resources. It is a multidisciplinary subject that encompasses the biological study of breeding, habits and life of different species of fish. It also includes husbandry and farming of essential aquatic and fish organisms in freshwater, marine environment and brackish water. Fishery as the name suggests is an organized effort that is pertaining to the capturing of fish inclusive and inland, sea or other aquatic species.

    It is related to catching inland and marine fishes for commercial purposes. It involves aquaculture, gears, navigation, oceanography, aquarium management, breeding, processing, export and import of seafood, special products and by-products , research and related activities.”
    
    A career in Fisheries Science will create modern fishermen, breeders, traders, exporters, farm managers and aquaculturists. The main aim of fishery science is making the much required technically competent extension personnel available for transferring technology. Fishery science courses can enable a person to execute fisheries development plans and even for development of such plans.
    
    Fisheries courses promise the most significant aspect as enlightening the students with the study of ecological factors that can adversely affect the availability of fishes, and the great significant role played by the fishes in maintaining the biological balance.  The vast extended coastline of India has made it a hub of the courses for fishery science. Also it has been successfully enlightening the students, building their career and protecting the ecology.</p>
